/**
 <SKYSignupUserOperation> is a subclass of <SKYOperation> which an user object
 in Skygear. Use this operation to create a new user account in the container.
 When a new user is created, an <NSString> and an <SKYAccessToken>
 will be returned.

 A user account is uniquely identified by an email address given by the user.
 If the user does not provide an email address, you can create an anonymous
 user instead and change the user information to associate an email address
 to this user later.

 A password must be supplied to create an user account in order to protect
 user content. For anonymous user account, you should generate a password
 on the user's behalf and save the password.

 If you assign a block to `signupCompletionBlock`, it will be called when
 the operation is completed.
